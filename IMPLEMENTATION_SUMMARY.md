# Classroom Management Application Implementation Summary

## What's Implemented

### Core Entities
1. **User**
   - Entity model with fields for username, password, email, fullName, and role
   - UserDto, RegisterDto for API operations
   - UserRepository, UserService, UserController

2. **Classroom**
   - Entity model with fields for name, description, section, subject
   - Relationships to teachers and students
   - ClassroomDto, CreateClassroomDto for API operations
   - ClassroomRepository, ClassroomService, ClassroomController
   - CRUD operations and enrollment management

3. **Assignment**
   - Entity model with fields for title, description, dueDate, points, fileAttachmentUrl
   - Relationship to classrooms
   - AssignmentDto, CreateAssignmentDto for API operations
   - AssignmentRepository, AssignmentService, AssignmentController
   - CRUD operations and classroom-specific endpoints

4. **Submission**
   - Entity model with fields for comment, fileSubmissionUrl, submittedAt, score, feedback
   - Relationships to assignments, students, and graders
   - SubmissionDto, CreateSubmissionDto, GradeSubmissionDto for API operations
   - SubmissionRepository, SubmissionService, SubmissionController
   - CRUD operations, grading functionality, and statistics

### API Endpoints
The application provides a comprehensive REST API for:
- User management
- Classroom management with teacher/student relationships
- Assignment creation, updating, and retrieval
- Submission handling and grading

### Demo Server
A SimpleGreetingApp.java has been created as a fallback due to Maven connectivity issues, providing:
- Basic API endpoints
- Demo data
- JSON responses

## Current Issues

### Maven Dependency Resolution
There are persistent connectivity issues when trying to resolve Maven dependencies:
1. Connection timeouts to repo.maven.apache.org
2. 401 Unauthorized errors to Spring repositories
3. Issues resolving required plugins

### Workarounds
1. Updated repository URLs in pom.xml to alternatives
2. Added properties to force HTTPS connections
3. Downgraded plugin versions
4. Created a standalone Java HTTP server (SimpleGreetingApp) that doesn't require Maven

## Next Steps

### Fix Maven Issues
1. **Remove Local Cache**: Delete ~/.m2/repository directory to remove cached failed artifacts
2. **Configure Network Settings**:
   - Check if a proxy is required
   - Try with a different network connection
3. **Use Local Libraries**: If dependencies can't be downloaded, consider adding them manually

### Complete Implementation
1. **File Upload Service**:
   - Implement file storage for assignment attachments
   - Create controllers for file upload/download
2. **Notification System**:
   - Add notification entities and services
   - Implement event listeners for assignment creation/grading

### Security Implementation
1. **JWT Authentication**:
   - Implement JWT token-based authentication
   - Create login/logout endpoints
2. **Role-Based Authorization**:
   - Secure endpoints based on user roles
   - Implement method-level security

### Database Configuration
1. **Production Database**:
   - Configure connection to MySQL/PostgreSQL
   - Set up migration scripts with Flyway

## Running the Application

### Using the SimpleGreetingApp
1. Compile: `javac SimpleGreetingApp.java`
2. Run: `java SimpleGreetingApp`
3. Access: http://localhost:8090/

### Using Spring Boot (when Maven issues are resolved)
1. Build: `mvn clean package`
2. Run: `java -jar target/classroom-backend-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`
3. Access: http://localhost:8088/
